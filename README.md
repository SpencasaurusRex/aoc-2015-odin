# Advent of Code 2015
Advent of Code 2015, solved using Odin.
  
Two goals:
- Improve problem solving skills
- Learn Odin

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2015) is a group of programming puzzles to be solved in any language.
They serve as great brain-teasers and tests of problem-solving skills

## Approaches
### Day 01
Pretty straightforward. Just loop through the input characters sequentially. Depending on the character received we can increment or decrement our floor number. The first time we reach floor -1, we print out the current position for part 2 of the puzzle.
### Day 02
For this problem, I looped through the input character sequentially to parse.
